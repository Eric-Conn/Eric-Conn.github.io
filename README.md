Welcome to Eric Connelly's website! 

I am an aspiring data scientist who graduated with a bachelors of science in mathematics from The City University of New York, College of Staten Island.

I am currently interested in problems where the leveraging of datasets, especially through machine learning, can be useful in finding good solutions and/or insights.
