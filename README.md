Welcome to Eric Connelly's website! 
I have a bachelors of science in mathematics from The City University of New York, College of Staten Island.


# About me:
I love mathematics. Cureently, I am interested in algebraic topology.
I am also interestd in integration.
I am always impressed when I see aq solution to a hard integral.
My next goal in algebraic topology is to read a research paper. I think reading a research poaper is a good goal becasue it gives my studies some structure.
