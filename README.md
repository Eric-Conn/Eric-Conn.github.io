## Eric Connelly's Website

Welcome to Eric Connelly's website! 

I am an aspiring data scientist who graduated with a bachelors of science in mathematics from The City University of New York, College of Staten Island.

I am currently interested in problems where the leveraging of datasets, especially through machine learning, can be useful in finding good solutions and/or insights.

Some other interests of mine are algebraic topology, differential geometry, and topological data analysis. I am currently reading through Hatcher and some topological data analysis papers.

#Thoughts About Topological Data Analysis

Given a topolopgical space X, where X meets certain requirements, there are topological measurements we 
can take of our space X.

For topological data analysis, we want to take topological measurements of a dataset.

For example, consider a dataset D where D can be thought of as a finite collection of points lying in 3-dimensional space.
We want to be able to justifiably create a topological space X(D) from these points, and from there measure X(D)
using topological measurement devices. From there, we want to use our topological measurements to say something about our dataset D and then the underlying phenomena of D.
