## Eric Connelly's Website

Welcome to Eric Connelly's website! 

I am an aspiring data scientist who graduated with a bachelors in mathematics from The City University of New York, College of Staten Island.

I am currently interested in problems where the leveraging of datasets,especially through machine learning, can be useful in finding good solutions and/or insights.

Some other interests of mine are algebraic topology, differential geometry, and topological data analysis. I am currently reading through Hatcher and some topological data analysis papers.
