Welcome to Eric Connelly's website! 
I have a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from The City University of New York, College of Staten Island.




I work on all sorts of things, many mathematical or algorithmic.

(not done, need to add a way to save graphs).


## About me:
{:.no_toc}
I am looking for a role in data science , data analytics, or machine learning. I have a background in mathematics and programming, with my preferred language as Python. I am currently a mathematics and statistics tutor at The Fashion Institute of Technology. I also tutor students in data analysis and machine learning.

# NYC Ferry Data Time Series Forecasting

Suppose we are data analysts working for the NYC Ferry. One goal of the NYC Ferry may be to predict boarding numbers and revenue for the next year in order to allocate resources efficiently.
Ferry ridership fluctuates up and down each year, so it's important to know if there are any trends, and what changes are due to trends and what changes are due to seasonality, if any, and also, what behaviour can be attributed to random fluctuations with a noisy pattern.

So, for this project we used time series methods to decompose our data into a trend component, a seasonal component, and a irregular component, and used this decomposition to create predictions for the NYC Ferry system boarding numbers for the next year.

Note: I have no affiliation with the NYC Ferry.

# U.S. Food Imports Data Time Series Analysis

This project is not done.

For this project we used transformed the dataset into a time series and then use exponetial smoothing to make future predictions.
