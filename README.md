## Eric Connelly's Website

Welcome to Eric Connelly's website! 
I have a B.S. in mathematics from The City University of New York, College of Staten Island.


# About me:
I love mathematics. Currently, I am interested in algebraic topology.
I am also interestd in solving integrals.
I am always impressed when I see a solution to a hard integral.
My next goal in algebraic topology is to read a research paper. I think reading a research paper is a good goal because it gives my studies some structure.

# Job Stuff:

I am currently looking for a job! I know how to program in Python. 
I will be posting some portfolio projects soon.
